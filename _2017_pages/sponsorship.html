  Ladies that UX Amsterdam is a welcoming and inclusive community that aims to promote female talent and increase female visibility. Our community is inclusive to all background, gender, age, race, and expertise.
</p>

<p>
  Our goal is to create a space for women in UX and tech scene of all levels to engage and talk about their experiences, both positive and negative, and get the support and inspiration that they are looking for.
</p>

<p>
  We love to establish mutually beneficial relationships with local and international events. As we get partnership requests weekly, we've put together a <a href="http://bit.ly/ltuxams-partners">Partner's Guide</a> that details what's required and how to move forward.
</p>

<p>
  All sponsorships include: Logo featured in event materials including conference website, event signage, programs, emails, and more!
